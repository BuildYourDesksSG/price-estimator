# Change Request — Implementation Log

All edits below were made to the `byd-price-estimator-refactor` source (the build that
matches the live site). Each edited file was syntax-checked. The app was **not** built or
run in this environment (no network for `npm install`), so please run locally to verify:

```
npm install
npm test       # vitest — suite updated to match the changes below
npm run dev    # visual check, especially the items marked [visual]
npm run build
```

Tests in `src/test/` were updated to match the new labels, the new grommet pricing
rule, the circle fee, the L2 range, and the added Beech species.

## Needs input / assets before going live (see ASSETS-TODO.md)

- **#7** Beech: confirmed $/m² rate + a swatch image
- **#14 / #23 / #24** New add-on product photos (uniform white-bg PNGs)
- **#9** The 25cm Left/Right offset: client to confirm the measured value
- **#21** MDF swatch images re-shot/rotated so grain runs horizontal (image-asset work)
- **#12** Confirm whether the cable tray should become *free/bundled* when Assembly is
  selected, or whether the new label text is sufficient (currently label-only; the
  separate Cable Tray add-on still charges $49)
